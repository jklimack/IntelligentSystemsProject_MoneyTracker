# IntelligentSystemsProject_MoneyTracker

Working as a team of two students, we developed a Money Tracker application for the final project for our Intelligent Systems Project course. The function of the application is to record a persons purchase expenditures by simply taking a picture of each of their receipts. The information from the receipt is then extracted and classified into different categories: tools, musical intruments, appliances, etc. Over time, the user can view their purchase history broken down into the different categories, such that they can in which category most of their money is spent. 

More information about the implementation of the application can be found in MAI_ISP_Technical_Manual.pdf, and information on how to use the application can be found in MAI_ISP_UserManual.pdf.
